# Tesla-Stock-Prediction-using-LSTM-ARIMA-and-SARIMAX-
This project focuses on Tesla stock price prediction using three different time series models: LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory networks), ARIMA, and SARIMAX. The goal is to analyze and compare the performance of traditional statistical approaches (ARIMA, SARIMAX) with deep learning methods (LSTM) for forecasting stock prices.
